*Important notes:* 
*1. Before working make sure to set up venv in django-backend directory and install requirements.txt*
*2. Work while keeping the env in mind and do not work with code that assumes a static, pre-determined local db or api call (to something like local host)*
*3. Consult with team members frequently in between changes to ensure everyone is on same page*
